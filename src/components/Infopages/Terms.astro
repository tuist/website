      <p>
        The intellectual property in the materials contained in this application are
        owned by or licensed to Tuist and are protected by applicable copyright
        and trademark law. We grant our users permission to download one copy of
        the materials for personal, non-commercial transitory use.
      </p>
      <p>
        This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This
        license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these
        restrictions or the Terms of Service, and may be terminated by Tuist at
        any time.
      </p>
      <h3 id="liability">Liability</h3>
      <p>
        Our application and the materials on our application are provided on an &#39;as

      <p>
        In no event shall Tuist or its suppliers be liable for any consequential
        loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party arising from the use
        or inability to use this application or the materials on this application, even
        if Tuist or an authorized representative has been notified, orally or in

      </p>
      <p>
        In the context of this agreement, &quot;consequential loss&quot;
        includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss
        of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of
        goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss
        of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under statute,
        contract, equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
        warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental
        damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
