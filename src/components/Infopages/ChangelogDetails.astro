          <h2>Project Milestones</h2>
          <p>
            Every project is a journey. You might have a clear end goal in mind,
            but the path to get there is shrouded in a fog of uncertainty,
            making it challenging to navigate and stay on track.
          </p>
          <p>
            To shine some light into the fog, we are introducing Project
            Milestones — a new way to divide and organize work within projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Milestones mark important points in a project’s lifecycle that the
            team needs to synchronize on. They make these key moments legible
            and break the project down into more granular phases.
          </p>

          <p>
            Creating project milestones in Lexington is easy: All you need is a
            name and a target date (the latter is optional). You can then assign
            issues to it (⇧+M is the fastest way to move an issue to a
            milestone).
          </p>
          <p>
            The project side-panel contains an overview of your milestones with
            progress data for each of them. Click on a milestone to instantly
            see all issues associated with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Milestones are also visible on roadmaps, highlighting the stage each
            project is currently in and how much progress has been made. This
            gives you a better understanding of what’s going on across multiple
            streams of work.
