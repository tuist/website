              Lexington Themes is legally required to complete what is called a
              KYC (Know Your Customer) Survey for every user that signs up,
              which includes completing identity verification for the person who
              chooses to be the owner, administrator, and representative of a
              Lexington Themes account. These requirements are intended to
              promote transparency and prevent individuals from using complex
              company structures to hide terrorist financing, money laundering,
              tax evasion, and other financial crimes. Usually, we are able to
              verify our users' identities automatically, but once in a while we
              are unable to and have to reach out for more information.

              Reserves are utilized to keep processing volume available within
              your Lexington Themes account to fund refunds or chargebacks.
              There are several possible reasons a reserve may be placed at
              onboarding. It could be that your business operates in an industry
              or with a business model that potentially creates additional
              credit risk, even if you are not yet receiving chargebacks. Some
              businesses may also collect payment far in advance, creating
              additional risk. Most reserves are temporary, however, and we are
              happy to revisit if you provide additional information by replying
              to the notification email you received.
