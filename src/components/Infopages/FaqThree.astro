              Well, think of Tuist as the basic superhero, and Tuist Cloud as that superhero with a jetpack! ðŸš€ Tuist has features that crave a server's touch for things like holding onto memories (state persistence) or flaunting a server-side GUI â€“ like the cool trick of build sharing. As organizations grow and spawn platform teams to boost developer mojo, that's where Tuist Pro really flies into action!

              Why, are you peeking into our crystal ball? ðŸ”® We're bursting with ideas but were time-crunched as this was our passion project during off-hours. But guess what? Once we dive into Tuist and Tuist Cloud full-time, we'll zoom ahead, offer stellar support, and launch features previously stuck in our dream vault. Our goal? To either be the trusty sidekick for platform teams or morph into the platform team for those flying solo. ðŸš€

              We're all ears for your challenges! Because, let's be honest, Apple often leaves us on 'read' with these issues. Many are stuck in a loop of reinventing or, worse, adopting a web of complexity. Join us in saying, 'Not today, complexity!' and let's bring simplicity to the masses!
