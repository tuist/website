        <strong>Restrict:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict
        the processing of your personal information if (i) you are concerned about

        we are in the process of considering your objection in relation to processing
        on the basis of legitimate interests.

        <strong>Objecting to processing:</strong> You have the right to object to
        processing of your personal information that is based on our legitimate interests
        or public interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate
        grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms,
        in order to proceed with the processing of your personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data portability:</strong> You may have the right to request a copy

        the deletion affects your use of our application or products and services. There
        may be exceptions to this right for specific legal reasons which, if applicable,
        we will set out for you in response to your request. If you terminate or
        delete your account, we will delete your personal information within 90 days
        of the deletion of your account. Please be aware that search engines and
        similar third parties may still retain copies of your personal information
        that has been made public at least once, like certain profile information
        and public comments, even after you have deleted the information from our
        services or deactivated your account.

        We may also collect publicly available information about you, such as

        collect and use your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a

        Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information

        the facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your
        information that has already taken place. When you contact us, we assume
        your consent based on your positive action of contact, therefore you
        consent to your name and email address being used so we can respond to
        your enquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where you agree to receive marketing communications from us, we will do
        so based solely on your indication of consent or until you instruct us
        not to, which you can do at any time.

        While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time,

      <p>
        The personal information we collect is stored and/or processed in the
        United Kingdom by us. Following an adequacy decision by the EU
        Commission, the UK has been granted an essentially equivalent level of
        protection to that guaranteed under UK GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>
        On some occasions, where we share your data with third parties, they may
        be based outside of the UK, or the European Economic Area (“EEA”). These
        countries to which we store, process, or transfer your personal
        information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in
        which you initially provided the information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we transfer your personal information to third parties in other
        countries:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          we will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of
          the UK GDPR (Article 45) and Data Protection Act 2018;
        </li>
        <li>
          we will adopt appropriate safeguards for protecting the transferred
          data, including in transit, such as standard contractual clauses
          (“SCCs”) or binding corporate rules.

      </ul>
      <h4 id="your-data-subject-rights">Your Data Subject Rights</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request
        that we restrict the processing of your personal information if (i) you are
        concerned about the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) you believe
        your personal information has been unlawfully processed; (iii) you need us
        to maintain the personal information solely for the purpose of a legal claim;
        or (iv) we are in the process of considering your objection in relation to
        processing on the basis of legitimate interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to processing
        of your personal information that is based on our legitimate interests or
        public interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate grounds
        for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms,
        in order to proceed with the processing of your personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Right to be Informed:</strong> You have the right to be informed
        with how your data is collected, processed, shared and stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Right of Access:</strong> You may request a copy of the personal
        information that we hold about you at any time by submitting a Data Subject
        Access Request (DSAR). The statutory deadline for fulfilling a DSAR request
        is 30 calendar days from our receipt of your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> In certain circumstances, you can ask
        for your personal data to be erased from the records held by organisations.
        However this is a qualified right; it is not absolute, and may only apply
        in certain circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>When may the right to erasure apply?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for
          which it was originally collected or processed for.
        </li>
        <li>
          If consent was the lawful basis for processing personal data and that
          consent has been withdrawn. Tuist relies on consent to process
          personal data in very few circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Company is relying on legitimate interests as a legal basis for
          processing personal data and an individual has exercised the right to
          object and it has been determined that the Company has no overriding
          legitimate grounds to refuse that request.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal data are being processed for direct marketing purposes e.g. a
          person’s name and email address, and the individual objects to that
          processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is legislation that requires that personal data are to be
          destroyed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Right to Portability:</strong> Individuals have the right to get
        some of their personal data from an organisation in a way that is accessible
        and machine-readable, for example as a csv file. Associated with this, individuals
        also have the right to ask an organisation to transfer their personal data
        to another organisation.
      </p>
      <p>However, the right to portability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          only applies to personal data which a person has directly given to
          Tuist in electronic form; and
        </li>
        <li>
          onward transfer will only be available where this is “technically
          feasible”.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If personal data is inaccurate,
        out of date, or incomplete, individuals have the right to correct, update
        or complete that data. Collectively this is referred to as the right to rectification.
        Rectification may involve filling the gaps i.e. to have to have incomplete
        personal data completed – although this will depend on the purposes for the
        processing. This may involve adding a supplementary statement to the incomplete
        data to highlight any inaccuracy or claim thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        This right only applies to an individual’s own personal data; a person
        cannot seek the rectification of another person’s information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Notification of data breaches:</strong> Upon discovery of a data
        breach, we will investigate the incident and report it to the UK’s data protection
        regulator and yourself, if we deem it appropriate to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Complaints:</strong> You have the right, at any time, to lodge a
        complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory
        authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however,
        appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the
        ICO so please contact us in the first instance using the details below. Please
        provide us with as much information as you can about the alleged breach.
        We will promptly investigate your complaint and respond to you, in writing,
        setting out the outcome of our investigation and the steps we will take to
        deal with your complaint.

        As PIPEDA refers to personal information using the term Personally
        Identifying Information (PII), any references to personal information

        Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information
        for a specific purpose. You may withdraw your consent at any time using
        the facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your
        information that has already taken place. When you contact us, we assume
        your consent based on your positive action of contact, therefore you
        consent to your name and email address being used so we can respond to
        your enquiry. Under PIPEDA, consent is only valid if it is reasonable to
        expect that an individual to whom the organization&#39;s activities are
        directed would understand the nature, purpose, and consequences of the
        collection, use, or disclosure of the personal information to which they
        are consenting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where you agree to receive marketing communications from us, we will do
        so based solely on your indication of consent or until you instruct us
        not to, which you can do at any time.
      </p>

        While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time,

        International Transfers of Information
      </h4>
      <p>
        While Tuist endeavors to keep, store and handle customer data within
        locations in Canada, it may use agents or service providers located in
        the United States (U.S.), European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom
        (UK) to collect, use, retain and process personal information as part of
        providing services to you. While we use all reasonable efforts to ensure
        that personal information receives the same level of security in any
        other jurisdiction as it would in Canada, please be aware that privacy
        protections under U.S. laws may not be the same adequacy.
      </p>
      <h4 id="customer-data-rights">Customer Data Rights</h4>
      <p>
        Although PIPEDA does not contain an extensive set of consumer rights, it
        does grant consumers the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the personal information organizations hold about them;</li>
        <li>
          Correct any inaccurate or outdated personal information the
          organization hold about them (or, if this is not possible, delete the
          inaccurate personal information)
        </li>
        <li>
          Withdraw consent for any activities for which they have consented
          (e.g. direct marketing or cookies
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="right-to-withdraw-consent">Right to Withdraw Consent</h4>
      <p>
        Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information
        for a specific purpose. Subject to some restrictions, you can, at any
        time, refuse to consent, or continue to consent to the collection, use
        or disclosure of their personal information by notifying us using the
        email address below in the ‘Contact Us’ section. Withdrawal of consent
        may impact our ability to provide or continue to provide services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customers cannot refuse collection, use and disclosure of their personal
        information if such information is required to:

      <h4 id="right-of-access-under-pipeda">Right of Access under PIPEDA</h4>
      <p>
        PIPEDA gives you a general right to access the PII held by businesses
        subject to this law. Under PIPEDA, you need to make your access request
        in writing and pay a minimal fee of $30.00.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any organizational fees seem unjust, you have the right to complain
        about this. We retain the right to decide how we disclose the copies of
        your PII to you. We will take all necessary measures to fulfill your
        request in 30 days from receipt, otherwise we must inform you of our
        inability to do so before the 30-day timeframe if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with our business
          activities; or
        </li>
        <li>
          the time required to undertake consultations necessary to respond to
          the request would make it impractical to meet the time limit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We can also extend the time limit for the length of time required to
        convert the personal information into an alternative format. In these
        circumstances, we will advise you of the delay within the first 30 days
        and explain the reason for it.

        Right of rectification under PIPEDA
      </h4>
      <p>
        You may request a correction to any factual errors or omissions within
        your PII. We would ask you to provide some evidence to back up your
        claim. Under PIPEDA, an organization must amend the information, as
        required, if you successfully demonstrate that it’s incomplete or
        inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may contact us at any time, using the information provided in the
        Contact Us section of this privacy policy if you believe your PII on our
        systems is incorrect or incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we cannot agree on changing the information, you have the right to
        have your concerns recorded with the Office of the Privacy Commission of

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Accountability.</strong> Tuist is responsible for the PII under

          accountability for compliance with the ten principles of privacy under
          PIPEDA, whose details are included below. All personnel are accountable
          for the protection of customers’ personal information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Identifying purposes.</strong> Tuist identifies the purposes for
          which personal information is collected at or before the time the information
          is collected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent.</strong> Consent is required for Tuist&#39;s collection,
          use or disclosure of personal information, except where required or permitted
          by PIPEDA or other law. In addition, when customers access a product or
          service offered by us, consent is deemed to be granted. Express consent
          may be obtained verbally, in writing or through electronic means. Alternatively,
          consent may be implied through the actions of customers or continued use
          of a product or service following Tuist&#39;s notification of changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limiting collection.</strong> Personal information collected will
          be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by Tuist.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limiting use, disclosure and retention.</strong> We will not use
          or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which
          the information was collected, except with your consent or as required
          by law. We will retain personal information only for as long as is necessary
          to fulfill the purposes for collecting such information and compliance
          with any legal requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accuracy.</strong> Personal information will be maintained by Tuist
          in an accurate, complete and up-to-date format as is necessary for the
          purpose(s) for which the personal information was collected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Safeguards.</strong> We will protect personal information with
          security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of such information.

        <li>
          <strong>Openness.</strong> We will make our policies and practices relating
          to the collection and management of personal information readily available
          upon request, including our brochures or other information that explain
          our policies, standards, or codes.

        <li>
          <strong>Customer access.</strong> We will inform customers of the existence,
          use and disclosure of their personal information and will provide access
          to their personal information, subject to any legal restrictions. We may
          require written requests for access to personal information and in most
          cases, will respond within 30 days of receipt of such requests. Customers
          may verify the accuracy and completeness of their personal information,
          and may request the personal information be corrected or updated, if appropriate.
