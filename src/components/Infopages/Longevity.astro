          <h3>Software made for eternity</h3>

          <p>
           <b>Tuist was built for the future of Xcode development.</b> We believe that code is abundant and should be owned by both everyone and no one.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tuist GmbH, a technology startup from Berlin, Jessnerstrasse 27A 10247, is the sole owner of the Tuist trademark, and provides core contributors for Tuist. Tuist is MIT-Licensed, but Tuist Cloud is closed source and proprietary to secure the funding for Tuist.
          </p>

          <p>
            With many active contributors, more than hundreds companies using Tuist, a sponsorships program, and a growing community, we are confident that Tuist will be around for a long time.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, in the unlikely event of Tuist GmbH discontinuing to support the Tuist repositories, we'll re-license Tuist Cloud with a permissive license and transfer ownership of the repositories to the top contributors at that given time.
          </p>

          <p>
            As long as Xcode projects exist, developers will continue to create exciting projects and prosper.             
          </p>

          <p>
            Weâ€™ll make sure they can build them, forever.
          </p>
