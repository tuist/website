            <h2>Dribbble</h2>
            <p>
              Dribbble is a social media platform for designers to showcase
              their work, get feedback, and connect with other creatives. It's a
              community of creative professionals sharing and discovering
              inspiring design work.

              “ I love how opinionated Navy is. It helps us move fast. There’s
              more “doing” and less figuring out how to do it.
            </blockquote>
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
              The tool has been designed to simplify my life and my team's life
              by aiding in understanding, decision making, issue triage, and
              follow-up. The built-in features of Dribbble have exceeded my
              expectations and provided a native experience that is nearly
              perfect. My evaluation of products is based on their ease of use
              in performing basic actions, such as changing or editing text, and
              in this regard, Dribbble is incredibly intuitive. Whether I need
              to edit text or move an issue, the platform works seamlessly,
              feeling like an extension of myself. The team's attention to
              detail and consideration for user experience is evident in the
              thought and effort put into developing Dribbble.
