          <h2>
            The magic of software seems to have disappeared, and we need your
            help to bring it back.
          </h2>
          <p>
            There was a time when using software was a magical experience that
            transformed how we lived and worked. It made us feel like we were
            living in the future, and good software was an immersive experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, software is ubiquitous, but truly excellent software is
            exceedingly rare. Computers have become faster, but apps have become
            slower. Growth hacks have replaced craftsmanship, and incremental
            changes have replaced visionary product ideas. In this way, the
            magic of software has been lost along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Navy, we're committed to bringing back the magic of software.
            We're developing tools for the next generation of high-impact
            companies, the place where ambitious creators bring their radical
            ideas to life. Our mission is to enable the world's top product and
            engineering teams to build products that evoke the same magical
            feeling that software used to bring.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we can't do this alone. We're looking for talented
            individuals who share our passion for crafting exceptional software
            products. If that sounds like you, join us in our pursuit to restore
            the magic of software.
